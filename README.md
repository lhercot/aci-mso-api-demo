# aci-mso-api-demo
 
This repository contains an Ansible playbook and a python script that showcase an example of using the ACI Multisite Orchestrator (MSO) API to automate common tasks.

The python script as a few dependencies:
  pandas
  requests
  json
It also uses the file cloud-aci-id.xlsx as a datasource.

The Ansible Playbook requires Ansible 2.8+
I also added my Postman library (mso-api-postman-collection.json) with the required Postman environment (MyEnvironment.json).

This is an example and should be used at your own risk!
